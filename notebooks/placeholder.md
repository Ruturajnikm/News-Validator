# Notebooks

Place Jupyter notebooks for training your model here. Example filenames:
- notebooks/topic_classification.ipynb
- notebooks/fake_detection.ipynb
- notebooks/sentiment_analysis.ipynb

Each notebook should contain: data download, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a section that saves the model into `/models`.
